I am currently a Visiting Masters student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India, affiliated with the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal, India. I did my undergraduation from IISER Bhopal, where I majored in Physics with a minor in Data Science.

For my Masters thesis project I am working on Quantum algorithms aimed at solving combinatorial optimization problems. One of the specific problems I am currently working on involves factoring using QAOA. 

Throughout my academic journey, I've had the privilege of exploring a wide spectrum of physics and computational courses. This exposure has fueled my enthusiasm for a research career in this interdisciplinary field.

I thrive on tackling challenges through computational techniques, whether it's applying quantum computing skills to address real-world issues or leveraging data science to solve complex physics problems. My passion lies in harnessing the power of technology to create a meaningful impact.


### My Research Interests:
1. Quantum Information Science
2. Quantum Algorithms
3. Quantum cryptography
