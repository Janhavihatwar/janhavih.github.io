I'm currently a Visiting Masters student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India, affiliated to Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal, India. I did my undergraduation from IISER Bhopal, with a focus on Physics and a minor in Data Science. My academic journey has exposed me to the vast spectrum of physics and computational courses, igniting my passion for a research career in this field.

I thrive on solving challenges through computational techniques. Whether it's real-world issues using quantum computing skills or tackling physics problems with data science, I'm excited about harnessing the power of technology to make an impact.

### My Research Interests:
1. Quantum Information Science
2. Quantum Algorithms
3. Quantum cryptography
4. Computational Physics
