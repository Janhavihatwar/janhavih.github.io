1. # PICO Bubble chambers, guided by Dr. Carsten Krauss, University of Alberta
We worked on the next-generation PICO-500 detector assembly for eventual deployment at SNOLAB, Ontario. We employed MATLAB for meticulous analysis of particulate levels within detector, enhancing the outcomes. Developed precision and problem-solving skills in the high-stakes environment of a cutting-edge laboratory. I acquired proficiency in LABVIEW, a graphical programming language, to create an intuitive interface for detector communication.

2. # Micropattern Gas Detectors, guided by Dr. Archana Sharma, Senior Physicist, CERN
We analyzed performance of Micropattern Gaseous Detectors and Radiation detectors on various levels. We also reviewed and evaluated research papers.
